According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the United States experienced a staggering 104% increase in analgesic drug prescriptions, such as opioids, over recent years. This surge is part of a broader trend that has had significant public health implications, contributing to a rise in substance abuse and related fatalities.

This project focuses on analyzing drug- and alcohol-induced mortality rates in the United States from 1999 to 2022, emphasizing race and gender as key variables. These demographic dimensions are closely tied to structural inequalities, cultural contexts, and access to resources, all of which can profoundly influence health outcomes. By understanding these connections, we can better appreciate how different populations are affected by substance use disorders and the subsequent mortality rates.

Our variable of interest, **Crude Rate**, provides a standardized measure of mortality rates per 100,000 individuals, enabling direct comparisons across different races and genders. This rate helps normalize the data, making it easier to observe and analyze trends and disparities. 

This study specifically seeks to answer these critical questions:
- How do drug and alcohol-induced mortality rates differ across racial groups and genders?
- What trends can be observed over time in these mortality rates?
- Which demographic groups are most at risk?
